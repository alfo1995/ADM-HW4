# AMD-HW4
This is the last project we did during the course **Algorithm of data mining** where we practiced on dealing with networks.

The data we had available concerned the publications made by the computer scientists, so we had to create a computer scientists Network and carry out some informations from this one. 

The file *modules.py* contains the code.

We decided to split it in a four parts:

* Introduction
* first point
* second point
* third point

## Introduction
In the introduction what we did is quite simple.

We import data from a Json file saving it in a variable called **data**, we start to observe the data (their structure) and wondering how to approach on it? are there any missing data? 

At this point, once we decided how to store, manipulate and parse the data, we start creating a dictionary which contains for each *computer scientists* all the publications that he did.

## First point
In this first part, after importing the library *Networkxx*, we implemented the code to create our Graph.
